Variables in Bash Shell

There are 2 big groups of variables in bash:

Environment variables

    This type of variables, help us to get info to the system in general. 

User variables

    This type of variables, help us to get info to the script that we are working.
    In this case, there are 2 types of variables too, Global and local.

    In the case of Global user variable, allow to get info from other script, only if 
    is execute from the same script that was created.

    And finally, Local User variable, allor to get info from the same script.

    Example of User variables:


        #!/bin/bash

        option=0
        name=Ignacio

        echo "Option: $option and Name: $name"
    
    Example of Global User variable:
    
        To allow to get info from other script, its necessary export the variable,
        and use it from the other script, for example:

        Script 1:

            #!/bin/bash

            option=0
            name=Ignacio

            echo "Option: $option and Name: $name"

            #export any variable
            export name

            #Call other Script
            ./Script_2.sh

        Script 2:

             #!/bin/bash
             echo "The name from Script 1 is: $name"

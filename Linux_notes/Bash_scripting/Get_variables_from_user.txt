Get variables from user

To get variables provided from the user, we need the command "read", and there are some
flags to use with the command:
    - read -p : Allow to get text, before request data.
    - read -s : Stealth mode, for password or sensible info.
    - read -n : Allow delimit number of characters.
    - $REPLY : Allow to get variable entered.
    
    For example:

        #!bin/bash

        option=0
        name=""

        echo "Enter following options:"
        echo -n "Enter option:"
        read
        option=$REPLY
        echo -n "Enter name:"
        read
        name=$REPLY
        echo "Option: $option, name=$name"
    
    Other example with flags:

        #!bin/bash

        option=0
        name=""

        echo "Enter following options:"
        read -p "Enter option:" option
        read -p "Enter name:" name
        echo "Option: $option, name=$name"
